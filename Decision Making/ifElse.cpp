/********************************************************************
 * if-else
 *  The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it 
 *  will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false 
 *  it wonâ€™t. But what if we want to do something else if the 
 *  condition is false. Here comes the C else statement. We can use 
 *  the else statement with if statement to execute a block of code 
 *  when the condition is false. 
 * 
 * if-else ladder
 *  Here, a user can decide among multiple options. The C if 
 *  statements are executed from the top down. As soon as one of the
 *  conditions controlling the if is true, the statement associated 
 *  with that if is executed, and the rest of the C else-if ladder is
 *  bypassed. If none of the conditions are true, then the final else
 *  statement will be executed.
